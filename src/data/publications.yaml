      We present a novel hierarchical planning framework for coordinating multiple LLM agents 
      in complex task environments. Our approach decomposes high-level goals into subtasks 
      distributed among specialized agents, achieving 40% improvement in task completion 
      rates compared to single-agent baselines on the AgentBench benchmark.

      This paper addresses the sim-to-real gap in deep RL for robot navigation. We propose 
      a domain randomization strategy combined with a learned dynamics model that enables 
      zero-shot transfer of navigation policies trained in simulation to real-world robots, 
      achieving 92% success rate in cluttered indoor environments.

    abstract: |
      We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that reduces memory requirements 
      by 70% while maintaining 98% of full fine-tuning performance. Our approach combines 
      LoRA with selective layer freezing based on gradient analysis, enabling fine-tuning 
      of 70B parameter models on consumer GPUs.

    abstract: |
      A comprehensive survey of vision-language models applied to robotic manipulation tasks. 
      We introduce RoboVLM-Bench, a standardized benchmark for evaluating VLM-based robot 
      policies across 50 manipulation tasks with varying complexity levels.

      An empirical study of RAG systems for technical documentation retrieval. We identify 
      key failure modes and propose mitigation strategies including hybrid search, 
      query expansion, and confidence-based retrieval filtering, improving answer 
      accuracy by 25% on the TechQA benchmark.

    abstract: |
      We present a transformer-based imitation learning approach for dexterous manipulation. 
      Our method learns from a small number of human demonstrations and generalizes to 
      novel objects, achieving 85% success rate on unseen manipulation tasks.
